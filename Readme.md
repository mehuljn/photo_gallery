# ðŸ“¸ AI-Powered Flask Photo Gallery with Gemini 1.5 Flash

---

## Overview

This project showcases a dynamic Flask-based photo gallery enhanced with an interactive AI chat assistant. Leveraging **Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash API**, the AI can "see" and understand the content of your webpage by taking real-time snapshots. Users can upload images, browse their gallery, and then ask the AI questions about the displayed content, receiving intelligent, context-aware responses.

* **Dynamic Gallery Display:** View all your uploaded photos in a responsive grid.
* **Interactive AI Chatbot:** A floating chat bubble provides direct access to an AI assistant.
* **Multimodal AI Interaction:** When you ask a question, the application captures a snapshot of the current webpage. This image, along with your text query, is sent to Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash.
